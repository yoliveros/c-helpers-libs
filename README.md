# NOTE
  This was supposed to be some kind of window manager lib like glfw that I was doing, following the [Travis Vroman](https://github.com/travisvroman/kohi) game engine series, but I didn't enjoy working with X11, so I just left this as some kind of C helper files from where I can take the arena and base files for later use in another projects.
  
  PS: The arena allocator is inspired by the one from [Magicalbat](https://github.com/Magicalbat/videos/blob/main/arena.c)
